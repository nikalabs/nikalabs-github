                <p>1. <strong>Inappropriate content:</strong> Content should not include any that involves threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and other displays of bigotry.</p>

                <p>At the same time, we do not appreciate those who abuse the scope of their own intellectual property rights.

                <p>1. Identification of the copyrighted or trademarked work that was removed, and the location on the Site where it would have been found prior to its removal;</p>
                <p>2.  A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed as a result of a mistake or misidentification. For trademark disputes only, include information sufficient to explain why you believe that you are not infringing the trademarked work; </p>
                <p>3.
