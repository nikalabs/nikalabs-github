              <p>For all registered FrontApron accounts, there are two levels of account profile and information sharing controls that are determined 100% by each account’s administrator(s) or owner(s)</p>
              <p><strong>Public </strong> – This refers to information that will be shared publically with ALL FrontApron registered users and certified FrontApron 3rd party service providers; </p>
              <p><strong>Private </strong> – This refers to information that will ONLY be shared with FrontApron registered users or certified FrontApron 3rd party service providers who are selected by the account owner or administrator;  </p>
              <p>By default, ALL information on FrontApron will be initially marked as <strong>Private</strong>  unless the information owner explicitly (opt-in) changes it to <strong>Public</strong>. </p>
        
              <p>2. FrontApron will not share any personal information: email address, cell phone number, first name, last name, location, and browsing information with third parties unless registered account users of FrontApron explicitly opt-in to share.

                <p>While you are allowing us to use the information that we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we do not share information that we receive about you with others unless we have: </p>

                <ul>
                <li><p>received your permission; or </p></li>
                <li><p>removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it. </p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>For information that others share about you, they control how it is shared.  </p>
                
                <p>We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above. Typically, information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted. For certain categories of data, we may also tell you about specific data retention practices. </p>

                <p>We may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services. </p>

                <p>We may allow service providers to access information so that they can help us provide services.  </p>
